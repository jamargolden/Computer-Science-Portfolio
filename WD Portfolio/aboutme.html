            <p>Hello, My name is Jamar Golden and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am a recent graduate from Indiana University Bloomington where I obtained a B.S in Computer Science. I also have experience with Graphic Design primarily using Adobe applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator. I have had an interest in Graphic Design for over 10 years and wanted to figure out how to incorporate this into coding. This is how I found a passion for Web Development, after taking my first course in high school I was hooked and was excited to pursue it in college. Now that I have graduated I am eager to begin my Web Development career.</p>
