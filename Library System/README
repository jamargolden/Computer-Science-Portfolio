LIbrary System Group Project

Description:
This Application is a complete library system that includes a sign-in, Book checkout/return, Penalty, and Inventory mechanics.
This program also has the ability to save the information from previous sessions. There are two possible account types including
Librarian and Student, both having their own respective abilities. When it comes to the Librarian you have the ability to add, modify, and
remove books as well as view students accounts and asign penalties if need be and view the status of all the books. As a student you have
the ability to search for books by various different descriptors, Login/Register, Check-Out/Return Books, and pay penalty fees. 

What I learned:
Whith this being a group project it gave me much needed experience in colaborating on a project. It taught me how to gelegate tasks
for a group and check-in to enusre that everyones tasks get done in a timely matter. This experience helped me understand the importance
in making readable code so that your peers can understand it as well as ensuring everyone is on the same page so that all the code 
can work together properly.
