Description:
This Application is used to find the number of Distinct Words within a given .txt file as 
well as the frequency of each string. Each string is individually printed with its
respective string length and frequency in the document. The application also gives the
documents total word count and line count.

Instructions:
This application is very simple, this file is already loaded with two .txt files (tinyTale.txt
and tale.txt) allowing you to just run the file as is. if you would like to change the file
to one of the given files or your own you will have to locate the "Run" file then go to the "main"
function and change the .txt file name in the test variable. 
*Make sure that the .txt file is in the correct file system

What I learned:
The skills that were gained from this project were learning to read files from another as well as
how to gather and review data.
